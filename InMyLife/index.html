      <strong>In My Life</strong> is a journaling experience guided by AI — designed to help you write, process, and grow with clarity and compassion.
      Whether you're holding grief, rediscovering joy, or simply seeking your truth, this is where your story can unfold.
    </p>

      <p class="text-xl text-gray-700 tracking-wide mb-12">A quiet place to reflect. A gentle nudge toward healing.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="max-w-3xl mx-auto text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-800 space-y-8">
      <p><strong>In My Life</strong> was born from the kind of journaling that goes beyond venting or note-taking. It emerged in the still moments—after heartbreak, during transition, through grief, and even in joy—when writing became a way to <em>stay present</em>, to <em>remember who you are</em>, and to <em>find clarity when the mind felt tangled</em>.</p>

      <p>For many, journaling is about:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-2">
        <li>Processing emotions like sadness, anger, or anxiety</li>
        <li>Gaining insight during major life transitions</li>
        <li>Building self-awareness and gratitude</li>
        <li>Navigating relationships with more compassion and honesty</li>
        <li>Exploring purpose, identity, or spiritual growth</li>
      </ul>

      <p>But even when we know how powerful it can be… it’s hard to start. Harder still to keep going. And maybe hardest of all: to be honest with ourselves.</p>

      <p>That’s why we created <strong>In My Life</strong> — a journaling experience powered by AI, but rooted in <em>human healing</em>.</p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4">A New Kind of Support</h2>
      <p>You don’t have to journal alone.</p>
      <p>Our AI companion is trained to meet you right where you are. Whether you're heartbroken, confused, inspired, or simply curious, it gently guides you into reflection with thoughtful prompts and compassionate responses. Like a calm friend or a wise listener, it offers presence without pressure.</p>

      <p>Sometimes the response is practical, helping you reframe a thought or spot a pattern in your life.<br>
      Sometimes it mirrors back your emotions, helping you feel seen.<br>
      And sometimes it simply offers space—a soft place to land when life feels heavy.</p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4">How It Works</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
        <li><strong>Choose your journaling intent</strong> — from emotional healing to creativity, from inner peace to purpose.</li>
        <li><strong>Select a question</strong> — or write freely with the support of AI reflections.</li>
        <li><strong>Receive gentle insight</strong> — designed to help you go deeper, stay honest, and grow.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>You’re in control of the pace. Want to write privately with minimal input? That’s honored. Prefer more interaction to help you unravel a feeling or clarify a decision? We’re here for that too.</p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4">A Personal Note</h2>
      <p>The first version of <em>In My Life</em> came to life through my own journaling. In moments when I felt unworthy or unsure, I turned to this process. I wrote to the AI, and it responded not with judgment, but clarity. It helped me stay calm when my mind wanted to spiral. It reminded me of my values when I was tempted to react. It helped me witness my inner world with compassion.</p>

      <p>That’s the real heart of this tool. It’s not about fixing you. It’s about loving the truth of who you are—right now.</p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4">Why AI?</h2>
      <p>Because AI can hold space without ego.<br>
      Because it’s available anytime, without expectation.<br>
      Because it never gets tired of hearing your story—again and again—until you begin to believe in your own healing.</p>

      <p>Whether you're navigating change, rediscovering joy, or simply trying to be more present, <strong>In My Life</strong> is here to walk beside you. This is your sacred space. Your words. Your truth. Your life.</p>
